This plugin allows easy, variable length summaries directly embedded into the
body of your articles. It introduces two new settings: <span class="s">``SUMMARY_BEGIN_MARKER``</span>
and <span class="s">``SUMMARY_END_MARKER``</span>: strings which can be placed directly into an article
to mark the beginning and end of a summary. When found, the standard
<span class="s">``SUMMARY_MAX_LENGTH``</span> setting will be ignored. The markers themselves will also
be removed from your articles before they are published. The default values
are <span class="s">``&lt;!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY --&gt;``</span> and <span class="s">``&lt;!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY --&gt;``</span>.

<span class="s">    Title: My super title</span>
<span class="s">    Date: 2010-12-03 10:20</span>
<span class="s">    Tags: thats, awesome</span>
<span class="s">    Category: yeah</span>
<span class="s">    Slug: my-super-post</span>

<span class="s">    This is the content of my super blog post.</span>
<span class="s">    &lt;!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY --&gt;</span>
<span class="s">    and this content occurs after the summary.</span>

Here, the summary is taken to be the first line of the post. Because no
beginning marker was found, it starts at the top of the body. It is possible
to leave out the end marker instead, in which case the summary will start at the
beginning marker and continue to the end of the body.

The plugin also sets a <span class="s">``has_summary``</span> attribute on every article. It is True
for articles with an explicitly-defined summary, and False otherwise.  (It is
also False for an article truncated by <span class="s">``SUMMARY_MAX_LENGTH``</span>.)  Your templates
can use this e.g. to add a link to the full text at the end of the summary.

Inserting the markers into a reStructuredText document makes use of the
comment directive, because raw HTML is automatically escaped. The reST equivalent of the above Markdown example looks like this<span class="se">::</span>
